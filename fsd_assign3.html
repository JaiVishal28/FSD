      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Hi! I'm someone who finds joy at the intersection of creativity, technology, and competition. Music—especially rap—is a big part of who I am. I love expressing myself through powerful lyrics and rhythm, and it fuels my energy and focus in everything I do. Alongside my passion for music, I’m deeply into coding and technology. I enjoy building things that solve real problems, and I'm constantly learning new tools and techniques to sharpen my skills.

            Outside the digital world, I’m a huge sports enthusiast. I never miss a good cricket match and I love playing badminton whenever I get the chance—it keeps me active and sharp. I'm also a big fan of hackathons and tech competitions. They challenge me to think quickly, work under pressure, and collaborate with others toward innovative solutions. Whether it’s crafting a flow for a rap verse or debugging code at 2 AM, I bring the same energy and passion to all my pursuits.
            
            I believe in continuous growth, staying curious, and pushing boundaries—both creatively and technically.</p>

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>OnlyLoans – Loan Management System (Python, Tkinter, MySQL)</h3>
        <p>OnlyLoans is a desktop-based Loan Management System developed using Python with Tkinter for the GUI and MySQL for the backend. The application manages end-to-end loan processing and customer information through a clean, user-friendly interface. It features five interconnected tables for users, loans, payments, interest tracking, and loan status. Key functions include adding and updating customer records, calculating EMIs, generating reports, and maintaining repayment history. This project strengthened my understanding of Database Management Systems (DBMS), SQL query optimization, and GUI development with Python.</p>

        <h3>VTU PDF Reader – Android App (Android Studio, Java)</h3>
        <p>This project is a dedicated Android app designed to help VTU (Visvesvaraya Technological University) students quickly access their semester PDFs. Built using Android Studio and Java, the app provides a smooth and intuitive interface for browsing, downloading, and viewing syllabus, question papers, and academic resources—all within the app. I implemented PDF rendering using third-party libraries, file caching, and basic offline capabilities. This project helped me improve my mobile UI/UX design, Android lifecycle management, and Java development skills.</p>
